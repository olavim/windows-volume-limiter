# Volume Limiter for Windows

- Set system-wide and device-specific maximum volumes.
  - A device's maximum volume is the minimum of system-wide and device-specific maximum volumes. For example, if the system-wide maximum is 50% and device-specific is 60%, then the device's volume may not exceed 50%.
- Settings are persisted between application restarts and device changes.
- Detects changes in devices.
